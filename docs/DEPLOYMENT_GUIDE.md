# NoteBoard Plus

NoteBoard Plus is a simple **serverless web application** built on **AWS**.  
It allows authenticated users to manage **notes** and **expenses**, and supports **file attachments** through pre-signed S3 URLs.

The project is deployed **manually (no CI/CD)** using the AWS Management Console and basic CLI commands â€” ideal for learning how to deploy a real-world serverless architecture step by step.
